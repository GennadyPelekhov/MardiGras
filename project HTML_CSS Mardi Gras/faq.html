                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                        businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is
                        just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not
                        licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In
                        some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
                        Orleans.</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
                        however, is on a different day each year.</p>
                        <p>Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the
                        day before Ash Wednesday.</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one
                        extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a
                        warm afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t
                        forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus
                        and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all
                        day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday
                        are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes
                        and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be severe. The local TV
                        and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates..</p>

                    <label class="faq-title" for="faq_7">7: Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?</label>
                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New
                        Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we used to use "taking
                        the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws
                        often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.</p>
                        <p>The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend
                        seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end
                        of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out
                        their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras</p>
                        <p>You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes
                        away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld
                        features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car depending on where
                        you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s
                        Day in March).
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner-city neighborhoods. Some
                        sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9
                        a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following
                        the Zulu parade.</p>
                        <p>The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of March, around St.
                        Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras
                        Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."</p>
                        <p>Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday closest to St.
                        Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super Sunday
                        called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific
                        details are available on these events at this time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-text">
                        <p>Even though every parade is unique, Orpheus, Bacchus, and Endymion feature the most intricate, massive, and extravagant
                        floats.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official definition for "super Krewe,” it is generally accepted that a super
                        krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and maintains at least 500 riders for its parade each carnival.”
                        Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we think there’s a little more to it than that.</p>
                        <p>Along with a large membership, super krewes have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much sought-after signature
                        throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known for their big before and after-parade celebrations with big-name
                        talent (i.e., the Bacchus Bash, the Endymion Extravaganza, and the Orpheuscapade).</p>
                        <p>The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a super krewe in 1974.
                        Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe status. Three all-female super krewes also take to the parade route,
                        including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx. With 1,600+ active riders, the Krewe of Iris, established in 1917, is
                        not only the largest female Mardi Gras krewe, but it is also the oldest.</p>
